1. Fork the repository

   1. If you'd like to get a tour of the codebase and a second pair of eyes during setup, snag a slot on [the calendar](https://calendly.com/vcarl/bots)
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
1. Configure env variable
   1. From the General Information page:

1. From the Bot page: 3 settings off, 2 settings on
   1. Public Bot off
   1. Requires Oauth2 Code Grant off
   1. Presence Intent off
   1. Server Members Intent on
   1. Message Content Intent on
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev`
1. Look for the following message in the logs, and open the URL in a browser where you're logged into Discord.
   - `Bot started. If necessary, add it to your test server:`

# Implementation notes

There are subtle issues when making some chaings. These are notes for steps to take to make sure it's done correctly when needed.

## Environment variables

Adding a new environment variable needs to be done in several places to work corectly and be predictable for new developers:

- Add a suitable example to `.env.example`
- Add to your own `.env` (and restart the dev server)
- Add to the action in `.github/workflows/node.js.yml`
- Add to the Kubernetes config under `cluster/deployment.yml

# Useful DevOps commands

This bot runs on a managed Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean. It's possible (tho beyond the scope of this document) to configure a local `kubectl` environment to access and control this cluster. What follows are reference commands for performing common tasks:

```sh
# Tail the logs of the production instance
kubectl logs -f mod-bot-set-0

# Force a restart without merging a PR (as of 2024-09 only 1 replica is in use)
kubectl scale statefulset mod-bot-set --replicas 0
kubectl scale statefulset mod-bot-set --replicas 1

# Copy out the production database (for backups!)
kubectl cp mod-bot-set-0:data/mod-bot.sqlite3 ./mod-bot-prod.sqlite3

# Execute a command on the production instance.
# Rarely necessary, but useful for diagnostics if something's gone sideways.
kubectl exec mod-bot-set-0 -- npm run start:migrate

# Extract production secrets (in base64)
kubectl get secret modbot-env -o json
```
